<h2>Trouble at St Catherine’s Dock </h2>
<p>In 1657 local residents and watermen from St Catherine’s petitioned the High Court of Admiralty complaining about <a href="http://archive.org/stream/cu31924091770465#page/n209/mode/2up">Jenkin Ellis</a> for taking up all the mooring space between St Catherine’s Stairs and St Catherine’s Docks. Ellis was a large cordwainer or shoe manufacturer who supplied footwear to the military but he also owned a large wharf at St Catherine’s. According to the petitioners he was renting out all the moorings to large vessels from France and the Netherlands, charging half-a-crown a week, and leaving no space for the local watermen to carry on their trade.
<p>Concerned only with his private gaines and profitts and with no care for the publique good, Ellis allowed up to thirty vessels to moor between the stairs and dock. Sometimes they were moored up to five or six vessels deep. Overcrowding had blocked the flow of the Thames, much to the inconvenience of the local residents and traders.
<p>The waterman <a href="http://www.marinelives.org/wiki/HCA_13/72_f.174r_Annotate">Morrice Briggs</a>, aged 55, had been working from St Catherine’s for over thirty years. The ground between St Catherine’s Stairs and the Dockyard used to be fair and sandy, he said. A man could walk at low tide and keep a drie foote. But since the river was much choaked. the ground is now sunck and filled up with mudd and soile, (above knee deep in some places).
<p>The fires aboard the vessels that burned night and day, also posed a threat to the local buildings. Worse still, the foreigners set and evil example by practicing their vain sports on the Lords dayes to the greate dishonnour of God and the scandall of true Religion.
<p>The <a href="http://www.marinelives.org/wiki/MRP:_HCA_15/6_Box_One">petition</a> was signed by twenty-eight men, all watermen or residents along the waterside. About half these men were able to sign their name which suggests that about half the watermen on the river may have been able to read and write.

<img src="IMG_0006.GIF" />
<h2>Early Bermondsey</h2>
<p>Bermondsey takes its name from a Saxon landowner. It was Beormund's eg. The word eg meant an island, a promontory of land or in this case an 'island' of dry land surrounded by marsh.
<p>In the Middle Ages a Cluniac Abbey stood in the heart of the settlement. It was founded in 1089 by a merchant called Aylwin Child. (At first it was a priory but it later became an abbey). However Henry VIII closed it in the 16th century but it lives on in the name Abbey Street. A man named Sir Thomas Pope dismantled the abbey. In its place a 'goodly house of stone and timber' was built using materials from the abbey.
<p>There was once a river called the Neckinger, which flowed through the area. (It now flows underground).
<p>Then about 1570 a man named Joris Hoefnagel made a painting called the Feast at Bermondsey. It shows a quiet village opposite the Tower of London. The painting also shows a boatyard on the Thames.
<p>However Bermondsey began to develop in the late 17th century. After the plague in London in 1665 and the fire of London in 1666 wealthy people began to move to nearby villages. They were close enough to London to reach it easily but were also away from the dirt and noise of the town.
<p>The Church of St Mary Magdalene has existed since at least the 13th century. However it was rebuilt in 1690. (It was also altered in the 19th century).
<p>In 1770 a man named Thomas Keyse discovered a natural spring on land he owned by what is now Spa Road. As a result of his discovery Bermondsey became a spa town. In the 18th century people believed that drinking mineral water was good for your health and many doctors prescribed water from the Bermondsey Spa to their patients. As a result Bermondsey boomed and in the late 18th century many large houses were built in the area. However the boom was short lived. The spa closed in 1804.

<h2>Modern Bermondsey</h2>
<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries Bermondsey developed into an industrial centre. It was known for tanning and leather working. There was also an industry making calico (a type of cotton).
<p>Furthermore as the port of London grew rapidly many wharves and warehouses were built at Bermondsey. Another industry in Bermondsey in the 19th century was food processing. Food was unloaded at the many busy wharves.
<p>In the 19th century Bermondsey was engulfed by the growing city of London. However Bermondsey was a poor area of London with many unskilled and casual workers. Much of its housing was dreadful slums.
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s the wharves and warehouses in Bermondsey rapidly declined as the port of London could not compete with more modern ports. Bermondsey became a deprived area.
<p>However at the end of the 20th century parts of Bermondsey were transformed. The London Docklands Development Corporation was formed in 1981 and it invested large sums of money in regenerating Bermondsey. Where once foodstuffs were unloaded and store in warehouses there are now flats, offices and restaurants.
